      "#DEAP - Enabling Nimbler Evolutions\n",
      "by Fran\u00e7ois-Michel De Rainville, F\u00e9lix-Antoine Fortin, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Gardner, Marc Parizeau, and Christian Gagn\u00e9\n",

      "DEAP is a Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm framework written in Python and designed to help researchers develop custom evolutionary algorithms. Its design philosophy promotes explicit algorithms and transparent data structures, in contrast with most other evolutionary computation softwares that tend to encapsulate standardized algorithms using the black-box approach. This philosophy sets it apart as a rapid prototyping framework for testing of new research ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The DEAP framework is designed over three following founding principals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data structures are key to evolutionary computations. They must facilitate the implementation of algorithms and be easy to customize.\n",
      "2. Operator selection and algorithm parameters have strong influences on evolutions, while often being problem dependent. Users should be able to parametrize every aspect of the algorithms with minimal complexity.\n",
      "3. Evolutionary computations are usually embarrassingly parallel. Therefore, mechanisms that implement distribution paradigms should be trivial to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the help of its sister project SCOOP and the power of the Python programming language, DEAP implements these three principles in a simple and elegant design.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Data Structures\n",
      "\n",
      "A very important part of the success of any algorithm - if not the most important - is choosing the appropriate data structures. Freedom in type creation is fundamental in the process of designing evolutionary algorithms that solve real world problems. DEAP's *creator* module allows to\n",

      "The best introduction to evolutionary computation with DEAP consists in presenting simple yet compelling examples. The following sections set forth how algorithms are easy to implement while keeping a strong grip on how they behave. The first section introduces a classical genetic algorithm and exposes different levels of explicitness. The following section presents how genetic programming is implemented in DEAP and the versatility of the GP module. The final example demonstrate how easy it is to implement a generic distributed island model with SCOOP.\n",

      "###A Simple Genetic Algorithm\n",
      "A commonly used example in evolutionary computation is the OneMax problem which consists in maximizing the number of ones by solution. The more ones an individual contains, the higher its fitness value. Using a genetic algorithm to find such an individual is relatively straightforward. Applying crossovers and mutations on a population of randomly generated binary individuals and selecting the fittest ones at each generation usually lead quickly to a perfect solution. A problem of this simplicity should be solved with a very simple program."

      "The preceeding code presents all that is needed to solve the OneMax problem with DEAP. The first two lines import the necessary modules. Next, on lines 4 and 5, two types are created; a maximizing fitness - note the positive `weights` -, and a list individual composed with an instance of this maximizing `fitness`. Then, on lines 7 and 8, the evaluation function is defined. It counts the number of ones in a binary list by summing its elements - note again the one element tuple corresponding to a single objective. Subsequently, a Toolbox is instantiated in which the necessary operators are registered. The first operator, on line 11, produces binary values, in this case integers in $[0, 1]$, using the standard *random* module. The next operator, on line 12, instantiates an `Individual` of `n=100` bits by calling repeatedly the registered `attr_bool` operator. The same repetition initializer is used on the next line to produce a population as a list of individuals. The missing number of repetition `n` will be given later in the program. Subsequently, on lines 14 to 17, the evaluation, crossover, mutation and selection operators are registered with all of their parameters.\n",

      "The main program starts at line 19. First, a population of `n=300` individuals is instantiated. Then, the algorithm, provided with the population and the toolbox, is run for `ngen=40` generations with `cxpb=50%` chances of mating and `mutpb=20%` chances of mutating an individual for each generation. Finally, on line 22, the best individual of the resulting population is selected and displayed on screen. The double list of the printed individual is related to the select functions that return in all cases a list, here of one element.\n",

      "When developing, researching or using evolutionary algorithms, pre-implemented canned algorithms seldom do everything that is needed. Usually, developers/researchers/users have to dig into the framework to tune, add or replace a part of the original algorithm. DEAP breaks with the traditional black-box approach on that precise point; it encourages users to rapidly build their own algorithms. With the different tools provided by DEAP, it is possible to design a nimble algorithm that tackles most any problem at hand."

Again, this example is exhaustive but still very simple. On the first 3 new lines (23 to 25), the evaluation is applied to every individual in the population by the `map` function contained in every toolbox. Next, a loop over both the population and the evaluated fitnesses sets each individual's fitness value. Thereafter, the generational loop begins. It starts by selecting `k` individuals from the population. Then, the selected individuals are *var* ied by the crossover *and* mutation of the toolbox. Once modified, the individuals are evaluated for the next iteration. Only freshly produced individuals have to be evaluated; they are filtered by their fitness validity (line 31).
